# GeoLogix Smart Contract
## Overview

GeoLogix Smart Contract is a Solidity smart contract designed to facilitate automatic payments for drivers based on their geographical compliance. The contract rewards drivers who remain within specified geographic zones for set durations and penalizes deviations from the designated areas. It integrates an ERC20 token to serve as the basis for a rewards system, incentivizing drivers to adhere to compliance criteria.
Features

    Automatic payments for drivers based on geographical compliance.
    Integration of ERC20 token for rewarding drivers.
    Penalization for deviations from specified geographic zones.
    Flexible evaluation of driver performance based on geographical data.
